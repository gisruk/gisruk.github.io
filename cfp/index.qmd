We are pleased to invite **1500-word extended abstracts** for the 32nd Annual GISRUK Conference, to be held **9th -- 12th April 2024** at the University of Leeds. The deadline is **Monday 8th January 2024** and submission is via Oxford Abstracts ([submission link](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/6800/submitter)).

Work presented at GISRUK covers a range of methodological approaches and application areas. We are particularly interested in papers that align with the conference theme --  **GIS for public good: data, theory, policy** -- but  below is a non-exhaustive list of typical focuses:

*Data/Methods*

* Spatial statistics
* Agent-based models
* Open data and code
* Reproducibility and inference
* Uncertainty quantification and analysis
* Machine learning and AI
* Data visualization and communication


*Application areas*

* Transportation and land use
* Environment and sustainability
* Health, neighbourhoods and housing
* Crime analysis
* Labour markets and economic geography

Submitted abstracts will be assessed by **at least two members** from the GISRUK 2024 Scientific Committee.

### Guidelines

* Submission is via Oxford Abstracts [submission link](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/6800/submitter).
* Submissions should be extended abstracts of no more than 1500 words.
* Abstracts must be prepared using one of these templates ([MS Word](../files/GISRUK2024_PaperTemplateSubmission.docx), [LaTeX](../files/GISRUK2024-LaTeX_template.zip), [Quarto](https://github.com/sdesabbata/quarto-gisruk)).
* **New**: Identify whether you would like your submission to be considered for the [GISRUK & OSGeo:UK GoFundGeo Award](/osgeo/).
* Authors should make efforts towards enabling reproducibility of their work, where possible. GISRUK do not produce specific guidance, but authors may wish to consult relevant documentation from organisations such as [AGILE](https://osf.io/numa5).
* Any queries can be directed to : [info@gisruk.org](mailto:info@gisruk.org).
