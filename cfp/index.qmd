title: Call for Papers
---
We are pleased to invite **1500-word extended abstracts** for the 32nd Annual GISRUK Conference, to be held **9th -- 12th April 2024** at the University of Leeds. The deadline is **Monday 8th January 2024** and submission is via EasyChair (details to follow).

Work presented at GISRUK covers a range of methodological approaches and application areas. We are particularly interested in papers that align with the conference theme --  **GIS for public good: data, theory, policy** -- but  below is a non-exhaustive list of typical focuses:

*Data/Methods*

* Spatial statistics
* Agent-based models
* Open data and code
* Reproducibility and inference
* Uncertainty quantification and analysis
* Machine learning and AI
* Data visualization and communication


*Application areas*

* transportation and land use
* environment and sustainability
* health, neighbourhoods and housing
* crime analysis
* labour markets and economic geography

Submitted abstracts will be assessed by **at least two members** from the GISRUK 2024 Scientific Committee and selected papers invited for full journal publication as a Special Issue (details to follow).

### Guidelines

* Submission is via EasyChair (details to follow).
* Submissions should be extended abstracts of no more than 1500 words.
* Absrtacts should be prepared using one of these templates ([MS Word](../files/GISRUK2024_PaperTemplateSubmission.docx), [LaTeX](../files/GISRUK2024-LaTeX_template.zip), [Quarto](https://github.com/sdesabbata/quarto-gisruk)).
* All abstracts will be subject to peer review and allocated to short or long presentations, or poster presentations.
* Authors should make efforts towards enabling reproducibility of their work, where possible. GISRUK do not produce specific guidance, but authors may wish to consult relevant documentation from organisations such as [AGILE](https://osf.io/numa5).
* Any queries can be directed to [Roger Beecham](https://www.roger-beecham.com/): [r.j.beecham@leeds.ac.uk](mailto:r.j.beecham@leeds.ac.uk).

### Key dates
