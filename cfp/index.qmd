GISRUK hosts research from across geographic information science, from fundamental research to applications of GIScience across many domains. This year, we are particularly excited to invite submissions that investigate **Process in Geographic Information Science,** including innovations in causal inference, graphical modelling, or re-thinking the link between the patterns we see and what we represent on our computer screens. Beyond this special invitation, we accept abstracts in the following topics, and beyond:

*Data/Methods*

* Spatial statistics & analysis
* Data visualisation and communication
* Data generation using AI or novel spatial data synthesis
* Reproducibility, replication, and meta-science
* Statistical/Machine Learning and GeoAI

*Application areas*

* Transportation
* Environmental and ecological modelling
* Gender & society
* Housing and urban economics
* Health and public policy
* Labor and production in economic geography

### Guidelines

* Submission is via Oxford Abstracts [submission link](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/76668/submitter).
* Submissions should be extended abstracts of no more than 1500 words.
* Abstracts must be prepared using one of these templates ([MS Word](../files/GISRUK2025_PaperTemplateSubmission.docx), [LaTeX](../files/GISRUK2025_PaperTemplateSubmission.zip), [Quarto](https://github.com/sdesabbata/quarto-gisruk)).
* **New**: Identify whether you would like your submission to be considered for the [GISRUK & OSGeo:UK GoFundGeo Award](/osgeo/).
* Authors should make efforts towards enabling reproducibility of their work, where possible. GISRUK do not produce specific guidance, but we encourage authors to include pre-registered hypotheses in their initial abstract submissions (if appropriate) and host replication code and data using  [FigShare](https://figshare.com/),  [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), or the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/).
Any queries can be directed to : [info@gisruk.org](mailto:info@gisruk.org).
