\section{Introduction to guidelines}

The purpose of providing these notes is to standardise the format of the short papers submitted to GISRUK 2015. These notes are based on author guidelines previously produced for the GISRUK conference series which in turn were based on other guidelines.

The pages should have margins of 2.5 cm all round. The base font should be Times New Roman 11pt, or closest equivalent and text should be single spaced. Each section of the paper should be numbered. Section headings should be left-justified and given in bold type.  A slightly larger font should be used for the title of the paper and the authors (16pt and 14pt respectively). The first line of each paragraph in each section should \textbf{NOT} be indented.

\subsection{Sub-sections}

Sub-sections should also be numbered as shown here. The sub-section heading should be left-justified and given in bold type (11pt). 

\section{Figures, Tables and Equations,}

Tables should be as shown below (or as close as possible) and should be referenced as Table~\ref{first_table} in the text.

\begin{table}[htdp]
\caption{GISRUK Conferences}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\hline 
Year	 & City \\
\hline 
2024 & Leeds \\
2023 & Glasgow \\
2022 & Liverpool \\

2018 & Leicester \\ 
2017 & Manchester \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{first_table}
\end{table}%

Equations should be centred on the page and numbered consecutively in the right-hand margin, as below. They should be referred to in the text as Equation~\ref{first_equation}. 

\begin{equation}
E=mc^2
\label{first_equation}
\end{equation}

Figures should be presented as an integral part of the paper and should be referred to as Figure~\ref{first_figure} in the text.
