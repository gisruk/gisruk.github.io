### Rail Strikes and Late Registrations

**Rail strikes 5th -- 8th April**.
We've just spotted that industrial action  is scheduled 5th -- 8th April across the rail network -- [details here](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/travel-information/industrial-action/). We *hope* that this won't cause too many problems before the ECR workshops on 9th April. The good news is that LNER and Cross Country are not affected by strikes on Monday 8th April,  but there may be some spillover disruption.

**Late Registrations** .
Registration is now closed, but please e-mail <a href="mailto:r.j.beecham@leeds.ac.uk">r.j.beecham@leeds.ac.uk </a> to request a late extension.

We're very much looking forward to seeing you in Leeds!

Welcome to the 32nd Annual GIS Research UK Conference. The conference will be hosted at University of Leeds on **9th -- 12th April 2024**.

GISRUK attracts international researchers and practitioners in GIS and related fields to share and discuss the latest advances in spatial computing and analysis. The work presented at GISRUK covers a range of methodological approaches and application areas, including: geographic data science, geocomputation, applied statistics, geography, health, urban and transport planning, crime science.

We welcome papers covering all aspects of GIS, both methodological and applied. There is also a theme for the 2024 conference --  **GIS for public good: data, theory, policy** -- around which keynotes and other activity will be structured.
