Welcome to the 32nd Annual GIS Research UK Conference. The conference will be hosted at University of Leeds on **9th -- 12th April 2024**.

GISRUK attracts international researchers and practitioners in GIS and related fields to share and discuss the latest advances in spatial computing and analysis. The work presented at GISRUK covers a range of methodological approaches and application areas, including: geographic data science, geocomputation, applied statistics, geography, health, urban and transport planning, crime science.

We welcome papers covering all aspects of GIS, both methodological and applied. There is also a theme for the 2024 conference --  **GIS for public good: data, theory, policy** -- around which keynotes and other activity will be structured.
