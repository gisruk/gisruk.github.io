Beyond the main conference venues outlined above, we have also curated a short
list of other places that visitors to Leeds may enjoy at the end of a conference
day.
These all lie around the city centre and can be seen on the map below.

* **The Bankers Cat:** Located within 5 mins walk of the conference venue and
around the corner from the train station, The Bankers Cat has a lovely selection
of beers and an area with large tables in the basement vault for groups.
* **Tapped:** Just across the road from the Bankers Cat, you will find Tapped
which also serves a great selection of beers as well stone baked pizzas.
* **North Taproom:** If you are looking to sample some of the brilliant beers on
offer from Leeds' local breweries, then North Taproom is a good place to start.
Run by North Brewing, this taproom serves a great selection of beers as well as
street food from Little Bao Boy.
* **The Northern Market:** Previously Assembly Underground (and Carpe Diem
before that), The Northern Market is now a beer hall and food market run by another of Leeds' local breweries - Northern Monk. If you are looking for a stop on your way up towards the conference dinner then this is a good one.
* **Whitelock's Ale House & The Turk's Head:** First opened in 1715, Whitelock's
stakes a claim to being Leeds' oldest pub. Tucked away down an alley off of
Briggate along with its sister pub - The Turk's Head - Whitelock's is a part of
Leeds pub history and serves a selection of real ale and independent craft
beers.
* **Below Stairs:** If beer isn't really your thing and you are looking for
cocktails instead then Below Stairs is a hidden gem. Tucked away on South
Parade, this cocktail bar boasts a unique menu worth checking out.
