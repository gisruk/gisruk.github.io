    "text": "The GISRUK conference series is trialling a mentorship scheme for conference attendees. This provides those who define themselves as ECRs (Early Career Researchers) an opportunity to discuss career development with a more experienced person in the field.\nThis scheme is completely voluntary, but we hope it enables conversations between people at different career stages, and offers an alternative line of support and advice to ECRs outside of other avenues.\n\nDetails and expectations\n\nThe scheme runs for 12 months between the annual GISRUK conference events, usually held in April.\nMentors and mentees (ECRs) can sign-up to the scheme in the days before the GISRUK conference once they are registered to attend.\nThe scheme team will assign ECRs to mentors based on the information given while signing-up to the mentor scheme. Efforts will be made to match individuals as best as possible to interests, but this may not always be possible.\nDuring the conference there will be a short introductory session which provides guidance on what the scheme involves, and allows mentees to meet their mentors.\nAfter the conference, the expectation is that mentees will lead any contact with their mentor – e.g. send an email to introduce themselves, ask for some guidance or similar when they would like to. A mentor does not replace a tutor or supervisor (where applicable).\nIf you have previously enrolled in the scheme as a mentee and would like to again and be assigned a different mentor, please sign-up. If you are happy with your existing mentor, no action is required if you both agree you would like to continue (though this should not be expected).\nMentors will be allocated no more than 3 mentees and will be expected to meet with mentees at least once during GISRUK and should try and engage with mentees at least once more during the 12 month period (in-person or online).\n\n\n\nEligibility\n\nYou should be registered and attending the GISRUK 2025 conference in Bristol.\nMentees – To register as a mentee you should consider yourself an ECR (Early Career Researcher).\nMentors – To register as a mentor, you should consider yourself ‘established’ in your field—determined by the norms of your position (e.g. the criteria for this may be different in academia and industry). You should be willing to commit a few hours over the next 12 months to engage with any mentees you are assigned, and be able to give advice on a range of matters ECRs may wish to speak to you about.\n\n# By signing up you also agree to the following:\n\nIn accordance with GDPR, details of all those who sign-up will be stored securely, will only be available to the scheme administrative team, and all details will be deleted within 18 months of the scheme starting. If anyone wishes to be removed from the scheme, or have their details deleted, they should contact the scheme team or GISRUK directly (info@gisruk.org).\nGISRUK is not responsible for the conduct of those who are members of the scheme as either mentors or mentees. If in any circumstances an individual is concerned or affected by the behaviour or conduct of someone, a mentor or mentee, this should be reported immediately to someone in a position of responsibility as well as the scheme team or GISRUK directly (info@gisruk.org)."

    "text": "For GISRUK Event Staff Approached About a Harassment Incident\nMake sure you understand the GISRUK Code of Conduct.\nMake sure you understand what an attendee expects from you when approaching you to report a harassment incident – see “Reporting Unacceptable Behaviour: For GISRUK Event Participants”.\nIF YOU CONSIDER THAT ANYONE INVOLVED IN THE SITUATION COULD BE IN DANGER, DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL 999 FIRST.\nAll reports must be made directly to one of the following:\nLevi John Wolf – Co-Chair of Conference: levi.john.wolf@bristol.ac.uk Rui Zhu – Co-chair of Conference rui.zhu@bristol.ac.uk Craig Robinson – GISRUK Chair: chair@gisruk.org\n\nIncident Report. Make sure you gather as much information as possible in written form, with an emphasis on the following aspects:\n\nIdentifying information (name) of the participant doing the harassing\nThe behaviour that was in violation\nThe approximate time and location of the behaviour and incident in question\nThe circumstances surrounding the incident\nOther people involved in or witness to the incident\n\nInitial response. This is a crucial step and it must be fulfilled with total responsibility. Depending on the severity/details of the incident, follow the guidelines:\n\nIf there is any general threat to attendees or the safety of anyone (including conference staff is in doubt), summon security and or emergency services and/or initiate an evacuation.\nOffer the victim a private place to sit, ask “is there a friend or trusted person who you would like to be with you or contact?” (if so, arrange for someone to fetch this person or facilitate contact). Offer your undivided attention!\nProvide them with your list of emergency contacts if they need help later.\nIf everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim’s request.\n\n\n\nPlease, carefully read, below, what NOT to do in case of a harassment incident report:\n\n\nDo NOT overtly invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that withdrawal is OK. This suggests that you want them to do so and is therefore coercive. “If you’re OK with it [pursuing the complaint]” suggests that you are by default pursuing it and is not coercive.\nDo NOT ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint. This is a staff responsibility. The exception being the involvement of security or police when there is no imminent danger to people.\nDo NOT offer them input into penalties. This is the staff’s responsibility\n\n\nStaff meeting. Within 2 hours of an incident report, at least 2 of the GISRUK 2022 Organising Team, including at least one Conference Co-chair, to decide:\n\nWhat happened?\nWhat, if anything, are we doing anything about it?\nWho is doing those things?\nWhen are/were they doing them?\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the GISRUK Chair should be notified of the incident as soon as possible.\nActions that can be taken by the Organising Committee can include, but are not limited to:\n\nIf specific action is decided to be taken against the harasser the conference co-chairs, or nominated deputies, will follow-up with the harasser. However, this should not be done alone and should be done as a pair or more of the Organising Committee. The communicating members of the Organising Committee will inform the harasser of what has been reported about them while protecting the anonymity of the reporter. Allow the alleged harasser to speak, giving their side of the story to the staff. After this point, if the report still stands and no significant new information has been obtained that may alter the decision, let the alleged harasser know what actions will be taken against them.\nThe decision on the action(s) against the harasser are the responsibility of the conference staff and could be on or more of the following:\n\nGathering more information\nAsking the person to cease the inappropriate behaviour, and warning them that any further reports will result in other sanctions\nRequiring that the person avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, another person for the remainder of the event\nEarly termination of a talk that violates the policy\nNot publishing the video or slides of a talk that violates the policy\nNot allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event\nImmediately ending any event responsibilities or privileges held\nRequiring that the person immediately leave the event and not return\nBlocking the person on social media platforms (for a defined time period)\nBanning the person from future events (for a defined time period)\nPublishing an anonymous account of the harassment\nReporting the incident to the person’s employer\nRequiring that the harasser refund any travel grants and similar they received.\n\nPublishing an account of the harassment and calling for the resignation of the harasser from their responsibilities (usually pursued by people without formal authority) may be called for if the harasser is formally representing GISRUK, e.g. a member of the Organising Committee. Typically, event staff have sufficient governing rights over their space that this option isn’t as useful. Any publication of the incident would anonymise the identities and would be approved by the larger GISRUK steering committee. Similarly, any contacting of a harasser’s employer would need approval from the larger GISRUK steering committee.\nFollow-up Communication. It is essential for the GISRUK event, in particular, and for the GISRUK community, in general, the manner in which we publicly handle such incidents. It is essential to transmit that such incidents are in complete discord with the community and not tolerated at its events, but with high regard for privacy. Depending on the incident, the conference chair or their designate may decide to make one or more public announcements. If necessary, this will be done with a short announcement either during the plenary and/or through other channels. No one other than the conference chair or someone delegated authority from the conference chair should make any announcements."

    "text": "GISRUK uses Zenodo to host the annual GISRUK conference proceedings. Zenodo provides an open access repository to host the proceedings and offers long term availability of these resources. Every GISRUK paper/abstract uploaded to Zenodo is given a unique DOI which allows for wider dissemination and citation of these works.\nThis year’s Proceedings will live at zenodo.org/gisruk2025.\nThere are a number of important steps to consider before your paper can be uploaded to Zenodo for the GISRUK 2025 proceedings. A simple checklist to prepare your document for the proceedings is provided below.\n\nThe final abstract document is a PDF document prepared using the GISRUK Template (Word, LaTeX, Quarto).\nNo additional changes, modifications, edits, or typesetting adjustments are needed to the final abstract PDF.\nYou have integrated the feedback provided by the reviewers as far as you are able. In particular, you are asked to take action where the reviewers have indicated issues around the formatting or presentation of the paper.\nThe figures, text, and tables in the final abstract PDF are typeset as you intend them to be read. Generally, tables/figures are placed in-line, rather than at the end.\nThe text is free of typographical errors, and has been thoroughly proofread.\nEach citation in the text has a corresponding reference in the bibliography.\nEach reference in the bibliography has at least one citation within the text.\nThe affiliations and contact details for all of the authors are correct at the time of submission. This includes the institutional names, addresses, etc.\nEach author on the submission has a corresponding biography at the end of the paper.\nThe submitting author, or a designated attending author, has registered for the conference. If the lead author is not registered, then the “presenting author” is indicated in the author information.\n\nOnce your abstract satisfies all of the above conditions, please email it to the conference organisers using the email address that you recieved when your abstract was accepted. The subject of the email should have GISRUK-Proceedings- and your abstract number (like, GISRUK-Proceedings-121).\nYour abstract must be submitted to the conference organisers by 23:59 GMT on 9th of April, 2025.\nWe respectfully reserve the right to exclude your paper from the GISRUK Proceedings unless it meets these guidance notes to the satisfaction of the GISRUK Proceedings coordinator(s). It is very important to ensure that the final PDF provided to us is ready to publish as is. Each item in the GISRUK Proceedings requires us to manually generate a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Any changes after a DOI is created must be carried out by the Zenodo team based on our request."

    "text": "Posters\nPosters can be a maximum size of A0 in a landscape format. We will provide the poster stands and pins.\nTo help us ensure the posters are up for display by the poster sessions, please bring your poster to the poster hall no later than 10:00 AM on Thursday April 24th. We will have conference staff/volunteers available to assist you in hanging the poster if needed.\n\n\nTalks\nTalk slots are 20 minutes. We recommend speakers prepare 15 minutes of material, and take questions for five minutes. There are three talks per session. Session information is available on the Program page. If you are slated to chair a session and cannot attend the conference, please let the local organising team know as soon as possible.\n\n\nChairing\nSession chairs are responsible for keeping the sessions to time. Speakers should present themselves to the chair of the session and come to an agreement about how to present. The rooms come with computers that can be used to show slides, or a speaker/chair can use their laptop for all presentations. However, please minimize the setup/teardown time for speakers by using a single device across the session for all presentations.\nChairs should ensure talks start at their scheduled times. This means chairs should give each speaker about 15 minutes to speak with 5 minutes left for questions from the audience. To support these timings, chairs should provide speakers with a non-verbal warning when they have spoken for 10 minutes (i.e. 5 minutes remaining), for 13 minutes (i.e. 2 minutes remaining), and 15 minutes (i.e. further speaking will cut into alotted question time). At 19 minutes, the chair must close the Q&A and transition to the next speaker.\n\n\nVoting for awards\nInformation will be posted at the conference on how to vote for your favorite paper. We will use voting from attendees to determine the Best Overall Paper and the Best Overall Poster. In addition, the GoFundGeo and the Sinesio Alves Junior prizes will be administered by OSGeo:UK and CASA, respectively."
