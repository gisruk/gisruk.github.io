**Dr. Stef De Sabbata** is an Associate Professor of Geographical Information Science at the School of Geography, Geology and the Environment, Senior Fellow of the Institute for Digital Culture and the Turing Academic Liaison of the University of Leicester. She is the Chair of the Geographical Information Science Research Group of the Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers). <!--Stef holds a PhD from the Department of Geography of the University of Zurich, where her research focused on geographical knowledge discovery for location-based services. She was a Researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute and a Junior Research Fellow at the Wolfson College of the University of Oxford, where she applied geographical data science approaches to the fields of internet studies and digital geographies.--> Her current research focuses on geographical artificial intelligence, including the development of spatially-explicit approaches to urban analytics – e.g., applying deep neural networks to geodemographic classification and the analysis of urban form and function – and the study and use of foundation models in digital geographies and cultural analytics. <!--In 2023, she was the lead guest editor for a special issue of the International Journal of Geographical Information Science on “GeoAI in Urban Analytics”.-->
