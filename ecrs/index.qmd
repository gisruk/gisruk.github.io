In this workshop, participants will delve into the realm of raster data to harness the power of spatial data for the greater good. 
The focal point will be the exploration of night lights data in Global South contexts, utilizing the R and time-series analysis to understand the evolution of economic activity within a country. 
The workshop will exploit both aggregates and disaggregated (10m by 10m) nights light data. 
It will also cover the integration of open street map data to evaluate the goodness of fit between night lights and Points of Interest (POIs) as proxies for economic activity.

Outcome:

Participants will leave the workshop with a deeper understanding of how GIS, night lights data, and time-series analysis can be harnessed for public good. 
They will be equipped with practical skills to analyse economic trends, evaluate spatial relationships, and contribute meaningfully to projects aimed at societal well-being.

This workshop will leverage the following R packages for an in-depth GIS analysis:

* R.utils;
* dplyr;
* sf;
* ggplot2;
* tmap;
* viridis;
* RColorBrewer;
* raster;
* terra;
* exactextractr;
* tidyterra
